# Committees

A large part of the work of the House of Commons and the House of Lords takes place in committees, made up of MPs or Lords. These committees consider policy issues, scrutinise the work and expenditure of the government, and examine proposals for primary and secondary legislation. 

Much of the work of the House of Commons and the House of Lords takes place in committees, made up of around 10 to 50 MPs or Lords. These committees examine issues in detail, from government policy and proposed new laws, to wider topics like the economy.

Select committees (see below) operate largely by an investigative process, while legislative committees operate mainly by debate.

## Select Committees

[More info](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/select/)

Both Houses establish select committees to conduct inquiries and to produce reports on a range of matters, from the conduct of Government to specialist subject areas.

Select Committees work in both Houses. They check and report on areas ranging from the work of government departments to economic affairs. The results of these inquiries are public and many require a response from the government.

House of Commons Select Committees are largely concerned with examining the work of government departments. Committees in the House of Lords concentrate on six main areas: Europe, science, economics, communications, the UK constitution and international relations.

## Legislative committees

Both Houses refer legislation to committees for detailed discussion and approval. These committees are part of the process of making laws and include public bill committees, delegated legislation committees and committees on private bills.

## Joint Committees

Joint Committees are committees consisting of MPs and Lords.

Joint Committees are committees consisting of MPs and Members of the Lords. They have similar powers to other Select Committees. Some are set up on a permanent basis, like the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Other appointments are for specific purposes, such as examining draft proposals for Bills on subjects ranging from modern slavery to stem cell research.

## General Committees (including Public Bill Committees)

These committees are unique to the Commons and mainly look at proposed legislation in detail. They include all committees formerly known as Standing Committees. The House of Commons has three Grand Committees

## Grand Committees

The Commons has three Grand Committees which look at questions on Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Grand Committees in the Lords debate Bills outside the Lords Chamber.

Grand Committees give MPs the opportunity to debate issues affecting their region. The Committees function in a similar way to the Commons Chamber, with ministerial statements and an opportunity to question the Ministers. Every MP representing a constituency in the region is entitled to attend Grand Committee meetings.

### Grand Committees: House of Lords

Most Bills which are not committed to a Committee of the Whole House in the Lords are instead sent to a Grand Committee. The proceedings are identical to those in a Committee of the Whole House except that voting is not allowed. This means that all decisions must be made unanimously. Any Member of the House of Lords may attend a Grand Committee.

### Regional Grand Committees

Regional Grand Committees were established in November 2008 but Standing Orders that set up these committees expired in April 2010
