The UK public elects Members of Parliament (Mps) to represent their interests and concerns in the House of Commons.

During an election everyone eligible to cast a vote in a constituency (constituents) selects one candidate to be their MP.

MPs can assist their constituents in a variety of ways, from making private enquiries on your behalf, to raising matters publicly in the House of Commons.

By raising an issue in the House of Commons, MPs can bring it to the attention of the press and public.

Nearly all MPs represent political parties. Members of the Lords are also organised on a party basis; however, Members of the Lords do not represent constituencies and many are not members of a political party.

MPs consider and can propose new laws as well as raising issues that matter to you in the House. This includes asking government ministers questions about current issues including those which affect local constituents.

MPs split their time between working in Parliament itself, working in the constituency that elected them and working for their political party.

When Parliament is sitting (meeting), MPs generally spend their time working in the House of Commons. This can include raising issues affecting their constituents, attending debates and voting on new laws. This can either be by asking a question of a government minister on your behalf or supporting and highlighting particular campaigns which local people feel strongly about.

Most MPs are also members of committees, which look at issues in detail, from government policy and new laws, to wider topics like human rights.

In their constituency, MPs often hold a 'surgery' in their office, where local people can come along to discuss any matters that concern them.

MPs also attend functions, visit schools and businesses and generally try to meet as many people as possible. This gives MPs further insight and context into issues they may discuss when they return to Westminster.

[All-Party Groups (APGs)](http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/) are informal cross-party groups that have no official status within Parliament. They are essentially run by and for Members of the Commons and Lords.
