# [Parliamentary sessions](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/calendar/)

## A Parliament
A Parliament is the period of parliamentary time between one general election and the next. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 sets the interval between general elections at five years.

## Sessions
Each Parliament is usually divided into five parliamentary years called ‘sessions’, beginning and ending in the spring. A sitting is a meeting of either House at the end of which the House adjourns (pauses) until the next sitting.

## Session Length
Before the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, parliamentary sessions varied in length within each Parliament. The calling of a general election would generally curtail a session and the session following an election would be longer, until the start of the new session marked by the Queen's Speech in November.

There is no fixed length for a session, but they generally follow the same pattern from spring to spring, with a number of recesses. The actual dates of sittings usually vary slightly between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Prior to 2010 sessions generally ran from autumn to autumn.

## State Opening starts a session

The State Opening for the 2016-17 session took place on Wednesday 18 May 2016.
So that is the start date of this session.

## Prorogation closes a session

The 2015-16 parliamentary session was brought to a close with a 'prorogation' announcement on Thursday 12 May 2016.

Prorogation marks the formal end of a parliamentary session. It usually takes the form of an announcement, read on behalf of the Queen, in the House of Lords chamber.

Once it has been read in the Lords, the same announcement is repeated by the Speaker in the House of Commons.
