# Urgent Questions

An urgent question requires a government minister to come to the House of Commons Chamber and give an immediate answer without prior notice.

An MP can apply to the Speaker for an urgent question if they think a matter is urgent and important, and there is unlikely to be another way of raising it in the House.

Applications for urgent questions must be submitted to the Speaker to receive an oral answer on the same day.  

If the Speaker agrees, the question is asked at the end of that day's question time.

The deadlines for application to the Speaker's Office are as follows:

* Monday - 11.30am
* Tuesday and Wednesday - 10am
* Thursday - 8.15am
* Friday - 8.30am

Urgent Questions are asked straight after Question Time on Monday to Thursday, or at 11am on a sitting Friday and may be repeated in the House of Lords.

The relevant Government Minister has to come to the Chamber to explain what the Government is doing on the issue raised. The Minister will then usually take questions on the subject from MPs

The Department is also asked to provide a backgroud briefing on the issue for the Speaker and declare any relevant interests.
