#Ministers

Ministers are the MPs and members of the House of Lords who are in the Government. They are appointed by the Prime Minister and each given a specific area of government policy to oversee. Ministers speak on behalf of the Government from the frontbenches during parliamentary debates and must answer questions put to them by other MPs or members of the House of Lords.
