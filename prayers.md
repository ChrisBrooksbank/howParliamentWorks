# Prayers

[More information](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/prayers/)

Sittings in both Houses begin with prayers. These follow the Christian faith and there is currently no multi-faith element. Attendance is voluntary.

In the Commons the Speaker's Chaplain usually reads the prayers.

In the Lords a senior Bishop (Lord Spiritual) who sits in the Lords usually reads the prayers. The text of the Prayers read in the House of Lords are printed in the Companion to the Standing Orders.

The practice of prayers is believed to have started in about 1558, and was common practice by 1567. The present form of prayers probably dates from the reign of Charles II. Members of the public are not allowed into the public galleries during prayers.

MPs and Peers stand for prayers facing the wall behind them. It is thought this practice developed due to the difficulty Members would historically have faced of kneeling to pray while wearing a sword
