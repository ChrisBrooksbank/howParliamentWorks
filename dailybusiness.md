# Daily business

The business of both Houses follows a similar daily pattern. For example :

* [Prayers](prayers.md)
  Sittings in both Houses begin with prayers. The practice of prayers is believed to have started in about 1558.
* [Question Time](questiontime.md)
  Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords to ask government ministers questions.
* Urgent Questions(urgentquestions.md)
  If something has happened which an MP believes requires an immediate answer from a Government Minister, they may apply to ask an urgent question
* Ministerial statements
  After Question Time (and any urgent questions that may have been allowed) a Minister may make an oral statement to the House.
* Debates
  The main business in both chambers often takes the form of a debate. This includes debates on legislation, general topics of interest or issues selected by the major parties.
* [Divisions](divisions.md)
  Members of both Houses register their vote for or against issues by dividing into division lobbies. Therefore, a vote is called a 'division'.
* [Early day motions](earlydaymotions.md)  
  Early day motions (EDMs) are formal motions speculatively tabled for debate in the House of Commons.
* [Written questions and answers](writtenquestionsandanswers.md)
   In addition to oral questions, MPs and Peers can ask government ministers questions for written answer. Government ministers can make written statements to Parliament as well as oral ones.
* Written ministerial statements
  Ministers can make written, as well as oral, statements to Parliament. They are normally used to put the day-to-day business of government on the official record and in the public domain.
* Judgments
  Made by the House of Lords which was the UK's highest Court of Appeal until 30 July 2009.
