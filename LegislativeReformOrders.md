# [Legislative Reform Orders](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/regulatory-reform-committee/regulatory-reform-orders/)

Section 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (the “LRRA”) gives Ministers certain powers to make orders (“legislative reform orders”) that remove or reduce burdens resulting directly or indirectly from legislation, and section 2 makes similar provision in relation to orders that promote principles of better regulation.  Section 3 sets out facts that the Minister proposing to make a legislative reform order has to address.  They include positive tests (need for legislation, proportionality and fair balance of interests) and negative ones (no removal of necessary protection, no unreasonable interference with rights and freedoms, no constitutional significance).  The Minister can only proceed if satisfied that all relevant section 3 tests are passed.

The LRRA cannot be used to:

* impose, abolish or vary any tax;

* create a new criminal offence or increase the penalty for an existing offence so that it is punishable above certain limits;

* provide for novel powers covering forcible entry, search or seizure, or the giving of evidence under compulsion;

* amend or repeal any provision of Part 1 of the LRRA;

* amend or repeal any provision of the Human Rights Act 1998;

* remove burdens arising solely from common law;

* remove or reduce burdens which fall solely on Ministers or Government Departments, except where they affect the Minister or Government Department in the exercise of a regulatory function;

* confer or transfer any function of legislating on anyone other than a Minister, persons or bodies that have statutory functions conferred on or transferred to them by an enactment, or a body or office which has been created by the legislative reform order itself.

* The Government has also undertaken that the LRRA will not be used to deliver highly controversial proposals.
