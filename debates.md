Both houses hold debates.

During a debate members discuss :
* Government policy
* Proposed new laws
* Topical issues of the day

## Purpose

The purpose of a debate is to assist MPs or Lords to reach an informed decision on a subject.

Debates in the Commons allows MPs to voice the concerns and interests of their constituents.

Members of the House of Lords can speak about issues brought to their attention by the public.



[Votes are often held](divisions.md) to conclude a debate, which may involve then passing or rejecting a proposed new law (legislation) or simply registering their opinion on a subject.

All debates are recorded in a publication called 'Hansard' which is available online or in print.

A similar system for debates applies across the Commons and Lords. 

Subjects are introduced as a proposal, or motion, by Members, then debated according to strict sets of rules.

## Structure


### Commons

Commons debates are often lively, with MPs intervening on each other's speeches to support or challenge what they are saying. It is a dynamic style of discussion, in which MPs generally respond to the points made by other speakers

Rules still govern debates. MPs have a right to be heard without overwhelming background noise, and unparliamentary language is not allowed.

### Lords

In the Lords many Members have considerable experience in industries, professions and organisations and they are able to put this experience to good use during debates.

The Lords is self-regulating. Therefore, there can be greater flexibility to examine an issue for longer than is typical in the Commons.
