How the Lords works with the Commons to make a bill law

Most bills start in the House of Commons.

Bills are physically walked to the House Of Lords wrapped in green ribbon.

So in Lords : 

The first reading is when a government minister reads the long title. ( A paragraph summary of bill )

Second reading is a debate.
Memers can tell government their opinion on bill and parts they might want to change

After second reading members can vote to throw out the bill there and then. This doesnt happen often.

After that a bill is open for amendments. Members come into legislation office to discuss changes they are looking for.

At committee stage everyone turns up and the bill is gone through line by line.
People suggest changes to see givernments opinions.

After that is the report stage. Bill is gone through line by line.
Amendments are now what is really wanted so more attention paid.

Final stage is third reading.

After that changes are added or not, bills are sent back from Lords to Commons.

Ping pong can then happen. Compromises are made until agreement made.

Then Speaker and Lord speaker stand up and announce bill has recieved Royal Ascent.

Final copy is printed and sent to Parliamentary archives which is the official record.
