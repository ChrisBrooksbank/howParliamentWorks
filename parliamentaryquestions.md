#What is a parliamentary question

A Parliamentary Question allows Members of Parliament to hold the Government to account using either oral questions to Ministers in the Chamber of the House of Commons or written questions.  

Ministers are obliged to provide answers to these questions.

##Oral Questions 

 Each day in the Chamber (Monday to Thursday) starts with an oral question time. Departments answer on the basis of a rota which can be found on the Table Office intranet page, each one roughly once every five weeks. There is a limit to how many questions can be answered at each question time, so Members’ questions are entered into a ballot, known as the shuffle, to decide who can ask a question.

###Substantive 

This is a question that is submitted to the Table Office and that will appear on the Order Paper. The Minister will give an answer at Question Time in the Chamber.

###Supplementary

Each Member who is drawn to ask a substantive question is then able to follow up with a supplementary question.

Often these will bring in an argument or a specific case which would not be in order to include in the substantive question.

###Topical
Some Departments also answer Topical Questions during their oral question time, and these enable Members to ask an oral question without giving notice of what that question will be. The first topical question at each question time is in the form ‘If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities’. The Member asking that question can then ask a supplementary question on any topic within the Department’s area of responsibility. Other Members who have been drawn are then called to ask their own questions.

There is a separate shuffle for Topical questions, conducted at the same time as the shuffle for substantive oral questions.

###Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) 
The Prime Minister answers questions every week, on Wednesdays. 

Most questions to the Prime Minister formally take the form ‘If he will list his official engagements for [the date of the question time]’; this is a platform that allows Members to ask a question on any matter of government responsibility. It is also possible, though rare, for Members to table substantive questions for the Prime Minister if they want to, which means the question is printed in advance on the Order Paper.

##Written Questions 
 
 Written Questions allow Members to ask Ministers questions relating to their responsibilities. They can be used to ask for information about a government department’s work, or to ask a Minister to take a particular action.

###Ordinary Written

These are questions that have no time limit for answer set by Parliament. 

They have a nominal date for an answer, which is usually two sitting days after the question is tabled, but in fact Departments usually take between one and two weeks to answer these questions. 

Departments set their own targets for answering Ordinary Written questions within a set time.

###Named Day
Departments are obliged to answer Named Day questions on the date which is set for answer. Each Member can ask only five such questions on each sitting day.

The earliest day for answer is usually three sitting days after the day on which the question is tabled, but you can choose a later date if you want, for example to increase the chances of getting a substantive answer when you know the data will be time-consuming to collate.

The Table Office can tell you what the next Named Day is, and the dates for answer are generated automatically if you are using e-tabling.

#Creating parliamentary questions

##Step 1

Table a question, which can be done by:
 
•E-tabling, which is available to Members when they are logged on to their parliamentary account. A link can be found on the Table Office intranet page. Click [here](https://intranet.parliament.uk/people-offices/offices-departments/commons-departments/chamber-committee-services/table-office/) to view this.
•A Member in person in the Table Office
•A Member on behalf of another Member
•Bringing or sending a copy of the question which is signed by a Member to the Table Office

Oral questions must be submitted by 12.30pm on the day of the relevant deadline.


##Step 2

Your question is checked by a clerk in the Table Office. They will either:

•Edit the question (to ensure it is orderly and in usual House style) and table it if it is a written question, or enter it into the shuffle if it is an oral question; or
•Ask the Member, or their staff, to contact the Table Office to discuss the question. This may be to request more information or suggest changes so that it complies with the House’s rules of order. This is known as carding a question. The Table Office will contact the member by email unless they have requested to receive a postcard on the letter board instead.

##Step 3
Your question is published:
 
•All written questions appear on the Parliament website and on the blue pages of the Order Paper the next day.
•Only those oral questions which are successful in the shuffle will be printed; they appear in a document called [‘Future Day Orals’](https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmfutoral/futoral.htm) online, and in the Order Paper on the day of that question time. They are also available in the Table Office in the afternoon of the day of the shuffle.


##Step 4
Your question is answered:
 
•Oral questions that were successful in the shuffle will be answered during the Department’s allocated question time in the Chamber. Often there is not time for all the questions to be answered; those near the bottom of the list may receive a written answer instead if that is the case.
•The answers to written questions are emailed to the Member and are also published on the Parliament [website](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-questions-answers/). You can also obtain a hard copy of all written questions answered on a particular day from the Vote Office

Government Departments are responsible for the timeliness and content of their answers. However, if you are unhappy with your answer you can seek advice from the Table Office, who can usually help you to draft a further question to follow up. 

The Procedure Committee also monitors answers to PQs and in some circumstances can take action in respect of unsatisfactory answers.

#Functions of Parliamentary Questions

Parliamentary Questions have two main functions:


1.To seek information – for example:  What the cost was of his Department’s recent consultation on bees.
2.To press for action – for example:  If he will bring forward legislative proposals to prohibit the destruction of bees’ nests.
 

If your question does not carry out one of these functions, it may be better suited as a topic for a debate, or something you should write to the Minister about.

#Rules of Parliamentary Questions
A number of rules apply to Parliamentary Questions. These are covered in more detail in the classroom course Drafting Effective and Orderly Parliamentary Questions and guidance is available from the Table Office and on the parliamentary intranet.

##Neutral Phrasing
Parliamentary Questions should not be written or asked in a way that advances an argument or is emotive.
 
Instead of::

What actions he is taking to tackle the appalling bloodshed taking place in the Ivory Coast?

Try::

What steps he is taking to respond to the humanitarian situation in the Ivory Coast.


##Basis in fact
A PQ must have a sound basis in fact. Newspaper articles are not, on their own, sufficient basis for a question.

Instead of:

What plans he has to abolish the minimum wage.

Try:

If he will make it his policy to abolish the minimum wage.

At the time of writing, stated government policy was to keep the minimum wage in place, so there was no basis to think the Minister had plans to abolish it.

##Readily available

PQs should not ask for information which is already in the public domain, or ask the Department to do a calculation using information that is readily available. 

 

This includes questions that have already been answered in that session, unless it is reasonable to think the answer is likely to have changed.

 

Instead of:

How many people worked in her Department in the last financial year.
