# Written Questions And Answers

Written questions are parliamentary questions that are put to government ministers in writing by MPs or Members of the Lords and that receive a written answer. 

These questions and answers are published online in the [Written Questions and Answers database](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/daily-reports/).

In addition to oral questions, MPs and Peers can ask government ministers written questions. These are often used to obtain detailed information about policies and statistics on the activities of government departments.

## Types of written questions

### Ordinary questions
Do not have to be answered on a specific date. An MP will date a written question for two days after they have tabled it.

The convention is that the MP can expect it to be answered within seven days of the question being tabled. 

### Named day questions
Named day' questions only occur in the House of Commons. 

The MP tabling the question specifies the date on which they should receive an answer. 

The MP must give a minimum of two days' notice for these types of question.

MPs may not table more than five named day questions on a single day.

### Oral questions not answered during Question Time

Questions originally tabled for oral answer that do not get answered at oral question time are submitted to the government department as named day questions and given written answers.

### House of Lords written questions

Lords enter questions on the Order Paper via the Lords Table Office. 

Lords may table up to six questions each day and can expect an answer within 14 days.
