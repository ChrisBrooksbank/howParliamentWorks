Certain documents are required to be laid before (presented to) Parliament. These include most statutory instruments, House Papers and Command Papers as well as the reports of certain statutory bodies. 

In the Commons, once a paper has been laid before the House it will appear in the appendix to the Votes and Proceedings. In the Lords, it will appear in the Minutes of Proceedings.

[Journal Office Guidance On Laying Papers](https://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/laying-papers.pdf)

The purpose of laying a paper before the House of Commons is to make the
information contained in the document available to the House and its Members.
Members may come to the Journal Office to look at a document as soon as it
is laid. Copies of laid documents should also be available in the Vote Office
shortly after they are laid.

Depositing a paper in the House of Commons Library does not constitute laying.

Once a paper has been laid before the House, it will appear in the Appendix to the
Votes and Proceedings. The Votes and Proceedings is the formal legal record of
what happens in the House of Commons and is published overnight at the end of
each sitting day and is available online.

Many documents are required by law to be laid before the House. These are called
Act papers and are referred to as being laid “by Act”.

Other papers are made available to the House by the Government. These are called Command papers and
are referred to as being laid “by Command”.

A paper cannot be laid by both Act and Command, although in some cases papers are laid by Act in the Commons
and by Command in the Lords.
