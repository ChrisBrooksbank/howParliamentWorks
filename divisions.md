# Divisions


[More information](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/divisions/)


When a vote is held in the Commons it is the Speaker who asks members to call out whether they agree or not. 
In the Lords it is the Lord Speaker who performs this task.


The Speaker or Lord Speaker then judges if there is a clear result.


If the result is not clear then the Speaker or Lord Speaker calls a division by announcing "clear the lobbies" ( Commons ) or "clear the bar" ( Lords )


A member takes part in a vote ( division ) by physically going into a different location (division lobby) either side of the houses debating chamber. Therefore this is known as 'dividing the House'


Many Members view the procedure of voting in person through the lobbies as an essential opportunity to speak to or lobby senior colleagues.


Divisions normally happen at a regular "moment of interruption" of the main business of the House of Commons :
* Mondays at 10 pm
* Tuesday at 7 pm
* Wednesday at 7 pm
* Thursday 5 pm
* Friday 2:30 pm
However divisions can and do sometimes take place at different times.


Members could be elsewhere in the Parliamentary estate when the debate is taking place, this doesnt stop them participating in the division.


Division bells are located throughout the Parliamentary estate and surrounding premises. 

There are different bells for the Commons and Lords.

Members only vote for divisions in their own house.

These division bells ring eight minutes before the doors of the division lobbies are locked.

At the same time that the division bells ring, the 'annunciator service' feed on TV screens display that a division is taking place.


The Commons name their lobbies Aye and No.

The Lords name their lobbies Contents and Not Contents.

Members pass through their lobbies.

Clerks record their names.

Tellers count the members.

Once the lobbies are empty the Speaker or Lord Speaker announces the result of the division.

A division takes about fifteen minutes.

## Tied votes
If a Commons vote is tied, which is very unusual, the Speaker has the casting vote.
Where possible no final decision should be made by a casting vote.

In the Lords, the Lord Speaker does not have a casting vote. Instead, the tied vote is resolved according to established rules (called the Standing Orders).

## Deferred divisions 
These allow MPs in the Commons to vote on a series of motions using ballot papers. This happens at a convient time ( currently from 12:30 PM  on Wednesdays ).

Deferred divisions can be used with motions on statutory instruments and on certain types of motion which are not subject to amendment, proceedings on Bills are excluded

## The Division List
This records the way in which members voted and is available to the public in Hansard, the following day and on the Parliament website.

## Commons Library briefings
The House of Commons Library produces briefing papers to inform MPs and their staff of key issues. The papers contain factual information and a range of opinions on each subject, and aim to be politically impartial.

## More Information

Provisions exist for what must happen if a vote is tied, for the quorum required for a vote, how pecuniary interests must be handled, and how Members may record an abstention. There have also been systems of ‘pairing’, organised between political parties, to allow Government party Members ‘time off’ from voting in exchange for a Member from the Opposition also being absent.
