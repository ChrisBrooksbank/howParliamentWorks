## [Acts of Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/acts-of-parliament/)
Acts of Parliament are known as primary legislation. Collectively, they make up Statute Law which along with conventions, court decisions and treaties is seen as the basis of the UK constitution. If a Bill is passed by both Houses of Parliament and receives the Royal Assent it becomes an Act of Parliament and part of UK law.

## [Another place](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/another-place/)
Another place (or the other place) is a term used to describe the other House in Parliament. By convention, members of the Lords do not mention the Commons by name - and MPs do not refer directly to the House of Lords - when they are speaking in the Chamber.


## [Backbench](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/backbenches/)
Backbenchers are MPs or members of the House of Lords that are neither government ministers nor opposition Shadow spokespeople . They are so called because, in the Chamber, they sit in the rows of benches behind their parties' spokespeople who are known as frontbenchers.

Traditionally, backbenchers were called 'private members'; when a bill is introduced by a backbencher it is still described as a Private Member's Bill.

## [Bicameral system](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/bi-cameral-system/)
Bicameral literally means 'two-Chamber'. A bicameral parliament is one that contains two separate assemblies who must both agree when new laws are made. The UK Parliament is bicameral because both the House of Commons and the House of Lords are involved in making legislation.

## [Bishops](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/bishops/)
As senior members of the Church of England, which is the established church, some bishops are entitled to sit in the House of Lords. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester and 21 other bishops in order of seniority together form the Lords Spiritual.

Further information on this subject can be found from the following links.

## [Black Rod](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/black-rod/)
The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod is known as Black Rod. Black Rod's role is similar to that of the Serjeant at Arms in the House of Commons. 

Black Rod is a senior officer in the House of Lords. He is responsible for controlling access to and maintaining order within the House and its precincts.

The Clerk of the Parliaments, to whom Black Rod reports, is in overall charge of the administration of the House, which provides all other services for Members of the Lords.

## [Clerk of the House](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/clerk-of-the-house/)
The Clerk of the House is the most senior official of the Commons and advises the House on its practice and procedure. The Clerk is politically impartial and sits at the Table of the House between the Government and Opposition frontbenches.

## [Clerk of the Parliaments](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/clerk-of-the-parliaments/)
The Clerk of the Parliaments is the most senior official in the House of Lords. The position is like that of a Chief Executive and is responsible for employing staff in the House of Lords, advising the Lord Speaker and the Leader of the House and on the accuracy of the text of Acts.

## [Committal motions](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/committal/)
A Committal motion is a proposal that a Bill should next be considered by a committee.

## [Committee stage](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/committee-stage/)
Committee stage is where a Bill is considered line-by-line and is normally the next stage after a Bill's second reading. It is an opportunity for changes to be made to the wording or for new clauses to be added.

## [Deferred divisions](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/deferred-divisions/)
In the Commons, MPs sometimes vote on a series of motions (proposals) using ballot papers at a convenient time (currently between 11.30am and 2pm on Wednesdays) instead of holding each division immediately at the end of a debate.  These are known as deferred divisions.

The result of a deferred division can be found in the Votes and Proceedings for the day it took place.

## [Deposited Papers](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/deposited-papers/)
When a government minister or the Speaker says that they are placing a copy of a document in the Library of either House for the information of Members, the documents are added to a numbered series called Deposited Papers. 

The vast majority of Deposited Papers are placed by ministers in response to parliamentary questions.

## [Dummy Bills](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/dummy-bills/)
A dummy Bill, consisting of the short and long titles of the Bill and the names of up to 12 supporters, is all that needs to be presented by a backbench MP in order to introduce a Private Members' Bill. However, the bill must be printed in full in time for its Second Reading.

## [Father of the House](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/father-of-the-house/)
Father of the House is the title given to the MP who has the longest record of continuous service in the House of Commons.

## [Financial Privilege](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/financial-privilege/)
Financial privilege refers to the special right of the House of Commons to decide public taxes and public spending. 

It may be used by the Commons as grounds for overruling any House of Lords proposal that has cost implications.  

## [Give way](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/give-way/)
To 'give way' or 'giving way' are the terms used by MPs who want to interrupt an MP who is speaking in the House of Commons. 

An MP cannot intervene when another MP is speaking to the House unless that MP allows it by giving way. There is no equivalent phrase in the House of Lords although some former MPs occasionally still use the term.

## [Grand Committees](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/grand-committee/)
In the House of Commons, Grand Committees are a forum for all the MPs who represent a particular nation within the UK to meet together and consider matters that relate only to Wales or only to Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Since 2015, Legislative Grand Committees for English or English and Welsh only MPs have also been used under the 'English votes for English laws' procedures.

In the House of Lords a Grand Committee has an unlimited membership and considers the committee stage of a Bill away from the Floor of the House. 

## [Hansard](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/hansard-official-report/)
Hansard (the Official Report) is the edited verbatim report of proceedings of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. 

It is published daily when Parliament is sitting and records what is said in the main Chambers of both Houses, as well as proceedings in Westminster Hall, Public Bill Committees and other general committees.

Hansard is available online for [House of Commons](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons) and [House of Lords](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords)

It lists the events and decisions of the day including the results of any divisions, any papers presented or committees appointed. At the end of the parliamentary year, these daily reports are combined to form the House of Commons Journal.
