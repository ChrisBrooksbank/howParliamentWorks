## [Acts of Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/acts-of-parliament/)
Acts of Parliament are known as primary legislation. Collectively, they make up Statute Law which along with conventions, court decisions and treaties is seen as the basis of the UK constitution. If a Bill is passed by both Houses of Parliament and receives the Royal Assent it becomes an Act of Parliament and part of UK law.

## [Backbench](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/backbenches/))

Backbenchers are MPs or members of the House of Lords that are neither government ministers nor opposition Shadow spokespeople . They are so called because, in the Chamber, they sit in the rows of benches behind their parties' spokespeople who are known as frontbenchers.

Traditionally, backbenchers were called 'private members'; when a bill is introduced by a backbencher it is still described as a Private Member's Bill.

## [Bicameral system](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/bi-cameral-system/)

Bicameral literally means 'two-Chamber'. A bicameral parliament is one that contains two separate assemblies who must both agree when new laws are made. The UK Parliament is bicameral because both the House of Commons and the House of Lords are involved in making legislation.

## [Black Rod](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/black-rod/)
The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod is known as Black Rod. Black Rod's role is similar to that of the Serjeant at Arms in the House of Commons. 

Black Rod is a senior officer in the House of Lords. He is responsible for controlling access to and maintaining order within the House and its precincts.

The Clerk of the Parliaments, to whom Black Rod reports, is in overall charge of the administration of the House, which provides all other services for Members of the Lords.


## [Hansard](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/hansard-official-report/)

Hansard (the Official Report) is the edited verbatim report of proceedings of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. 

It is published daily when Parliament is sitting and records what is said in the main Chambers of both Houses, as well as proceedings in Westminster Hall, Public Bill Committees and other general committees.

## [Serjeant at Arms](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/serjeant-at-arms/)
The Serjeant at Arms is responsible for the order and security of the House of Commons including maintaining order in the chamber, galleries and committee rooms of the House and controlling access to the parliamentary estate.

The Serjeant at Arms also performs ceremonial duties including carrying the mace in the Speaker's Procession each day. The Serjeant at Arms is the only person in the House of Commons allowed to carry a sword.

## [Votes and Proceedings](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/votes-and-proceedings/)
