# Lobbying

Lobbying is when an individual or a group tries to persuade someone in Parliament to support a particular policy or campaign. 

Lobbying can be done in person, by sending letters and emails or via social media.

Anyone can lobby their MP or a member of House of Lords but it is usually more effective if you can find other people who share your concerns or experiences to lobby with you as a group.

People who often lobby Parliament and its members include businesses, charities, pressure groups, trade unions and representatives of various sectors of industry.

There are many ways to make your case. Some of the most commonly used are:

* Sending emails or letters
* Organising and presenting a petition or survey
* Providing information or research to back up your case
* Inviting an MP or a member of the Lords to a meeting or event where they can find out more about the issue

A mass lobby is when a large number of people contact their MPs and members of the Lords in advance and arrange to meet with them at Parliament all on the same day. Mass lobbies are usually organised by larger national or regional campaign groups who arrange for them to coincide with a public rally or demonstration in London.
