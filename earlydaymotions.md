# Early Day Motions

Early Day Motions (EDMs) are formal motions submitted for debate in the House of Commons. 

As there is no specific time allocated to EDMs very few are debated. 

However, many attract a great deal of public interest and media coverage.  

[EDMs](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/business-papers/commons/early-day-motions/early-day-motion/) are used to put on record the views of individual MPs or to draw attention to specific events or campaigns. Topics covered by EDMs vary widely.

By attracting the signatures of other MPs, they can be used to demonstrate the level of parliamentary support for a particular cause or point of view.

In an average session only six or seven EDMs reach over two hundred signatures. Around seventy or eighty get over one hundred signatures. The majority will attract only one or two signatures.

The [EDM database](https://www.parliament.uk/edm) contains up-to-date information on the latest EDMs and signatures added to existing EDMs.
