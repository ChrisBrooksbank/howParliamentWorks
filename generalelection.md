# General Election

When Parliament is dissolved every seat in the House of Commons becomes vacant and a general election is held. Each constituency in the UK elects one Member of Parliament (MP) to a seat in the House of Commons. Usually the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons forms the Government.

A general election is an opportunity for people in every part of the UK to choose their MP - the person who will represent their local area (constituency) in the House of Commons for up to five years. 

There is normally a choice of several candidates in each constituency, some of which are the local candidates for national political parties. People can only vote for one of the candidates and the candidate that receives most votes becomes their MP.

## When are General Elections Held

The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 sets the interval between general elections at five years. At the end of this time a new House of Commons must be elected.

The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 provides for general elections to be held on the first Thursday in May every five years. 

However, there are two provisions that trigger an election other than at five year intervals:

* a motion of no confidence is passed in Her Majesty's Government by a simple majority and 14 days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed

* a motion for a general election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats (currently 434 out of 650)

## Who chooses the Prime Minister?

The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen, who is guided by [constitutional conventions](https://www.royal.uk/queen-and-government).

[The Cabinet Manual](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-manual) sets out the main laws, rules and conventions affecting the conduct and operation of government, including the role of the Sovereign.
