#Bill Types

A Bill is a proposal for a new law, or a proposal to change an existing law that is presented for debate before Parliament.

Bills are introduced in either the House of Commons or House of Lords for examination, discussion and amendment.

When both Houses have agreed on the content of a Bill it is then presented to the reigning monarch for approval (known as Royal Assent).

Once Royal Assent is given a Bill becomes an Act of Parliament and is law.


Different types of Bills can be introduced by:

* The government
* Individual MPs or Lords
* Private individuals or organisations

There are three different types of Bill: Public, Private and Hybrid Bills. There is also another kind of Public Bill called Private Members' Bills.

##Public Bills

Public Bills change the law as it applies to the general population and are the most common type of Bill introduced in Parliament.

Government ministers propose the majority of Public Bills, those put forward by other MPs or Lords are known as Private Members' Bills.

Members of the public who want to voice their objections to Public Bills can do so by:

* writing to their MP or a Lord
* writing to the government department responsible for the Bill
* lobbying Parliament
* submitting evidence to the relevant Public Bill Committee

##Private Members Bills

Private Members' Bills are Public Bills introduced by MPs and Lords who are not government ministers.

As with other Public Bills their purpose is to change the law as it applies to the general population.

A minority of Private Members' Bills become law but, by creating publicity around an issue, they may affect legislation indirectly.

Like other Public Bills, Private Members' Bills can be introduced in either House and must go through the same set stages. However, as less time is allocated to these Bills, it is less likely that they will proceed through all the stages.

There are three ways of introducing Private Members' Bills in the House of Commons: the Ballot, the Ten Minute Rule and Presentation.

###The Ballot

Ballot Bills have the best chance of becoming law, as they get priority for the limited amount of debating time available

The names of Members applying for a Bill are drawn in a ballot held on the second sitting Thursday of a parliamentary session.

Normally, the first seven ballot Bills are most likely to get a day's debate.

The first reading (formal presentation - no debate) of ballot Bills takes place on the fifth sitting Wednesday of a parliamentary session.

###Ten Minute Rule

Ten Minute Rule Bills are often an opportunity for Members to voice an opinion on a subject or aspect of existing legislation, rather than a serious attempt to get a Bill passed.

Members make speeches of no more than ten minutes outlining their position, which another Member may oppose in a similar short statement. It is a good opportunity to raise the profile of an issue and to see whether it has support among other Members.

###Presentation

Any Member may introduce a Bill in this way as long as he or she has previously given notice of their intention to do so. Members formally introduce the title of the Bill but do not speak in support of it - they rarely become law.

Private Members' Bills have precedence over government business on thirteen Fridays in each session 

#Private Bills

Private Bills are usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, to give themselves powers beyond, or in conflict with, the general law.

Private Bills only change the law as it applies to specific individuals or organisations, rather than the general public. 

Groups or individuals potentially affected by these changes can petition Parliament against the proposed Bill and present their objections to committees of MPs and Lords.

#Hybrid Bills

Hybrid Bills mix the characteristics of Public and Private Bills. 

The changes to the law proposed by a Hybrid Bill would affect the general public but would also have a significant impact for specific individuals or groups. 

The Bill passed concerning the construction of the Channel Tunnel was an example of a Hybrid Bill.

Hybrid Bills often propose works of national importance but in a specific area of the UK. Examples are the Channel Tunnel Bills passed in the 1970s and 1980s that affected the South East of the UK, and the Crossrail Bill to build a new east to west rail link through central London passed in 2008.

The main High Speed 2 legislation currently passing through Parliament is a Hybrid Bill.

The Public Bill Offices decide whether a Bill falls into the Hybrid category. Both Houses debate these Bills and they go through a longer parliamentary process than Public Bills.
